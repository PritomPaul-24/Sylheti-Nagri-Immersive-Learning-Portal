## 2. Problem Statement

Despite its rich historical and cultural significance, **Sylheti Nagri** is at risk of extinction due to:

- Absence of modern digital learning tools  
- Limited educational integration  
- Low youth engagement  
- Lack of immersive and interactive learning experiences  
- Poor accessibility in rural and low-bandwidth regions  

Traditional text-based approaches fail to preserve learner interest and cultural depth, making it difficult to sustain the script for future generations.
